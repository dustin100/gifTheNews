A fun mash-up of gifs and news articles. Built, in React this app uses the NewsAPI and the Giphy API to mashup up the top 18 results from a userâ€™s query.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Improvements

- occasionally user is displayed a blank screen on 1st search
- add dropdown to all user to select category of new they want to display (tech, world, politics, ect..)
- display error message after Giphy API rate limit is hit
