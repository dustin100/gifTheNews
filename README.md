<img src="https://www.dustinkelly.dev/img/gif-the-news.jpg">

A fun mash-up of gifs and news articles. Built, in React this app uses the NewsAPI and the Giphy API to mashup up the top 20 results from a userâ€™s query.

## How to use this repository :monocle_face:

Clone the repository and ensure the latest version of Node.js is installed on your machine.
Run npm install to install all dependencies.

In the project directory, you can run: npm run start

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Improvements Needed

- occasionally user is displayed a blank screen on 1st search
- add dropdown to all user to select category of new they want to display (tech, world, politics, ect..)
- display error message after Giphy API rate limit is hit
- Some news articles return html which need to be removed
